# House Price Prediction using XGBoost
This project focuses on predicting house prices using XGBoost, a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm based on gradient boosting. XGBoost is well-suited for this regression problem due to its speed, performance, and ability to handle large datasets.
## Key Components of the Project
1. Dataset: The dataset used in this project includes a variety of features that impact house prices, such as:
Number of rooms
Square footage
Location
Age of the house
Other relevant property details
