# House Price Prediction using XGBoost
This project focuses on predicting house prices using XGBoost, a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm based on gradient boosting. XGBoost is well-suited for this regression problem due to its speed, performance, and ability to handle large datasets.
## Key Components of the Project
1. Dataset: The dataset used in this project includes a variety of features that impact house prices, such as:
- Number of rooms
- Square footage
- Location
- Age of the house
- Other relevant property details
 ##### The goal is to predict the sale price of houses based on these input features.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling Missing Data: The dataset is cleaned by dealing with missing values. Missing data can skew the model’s results, so appropriate strategies are applied to impute or remove missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Key features are selected and, if necessary, transformed to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Data Normalization: Features are scaled to standardize the input, allowing the model to converge faster and improve predictions.
3. Model Selection: XGBoost:
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is used to model the relationship between the features and house prices. XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm that builds models sequentially, where each new model attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones.
- Advantages of XGBoost include handling missing data automatically, feature importance ranking, and superior speed due to its efficient implementation.
4. Model Training:
- The dataset is split into training and test sets.
- The XGBoost Regressor model is trained on the training dataset.
-  XGBoost optimizes the model using gradient boosting, where the loss function is minimized through iterative improvements of the model’s performance.
5. Model Evaluation: he performance of the XGBoost model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- R-squared (R²) Error: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the house prices. A higher R² value (closer to 1) indicates a better model.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average difference between the actual and predicted prices, giving an indication of the model’s accuracy.

   In this project:
  - R-squared error: 0.88, meaning that 88% of the variance in house prices is explained by the model.
  - Mean Absolute Error: Approximately $19,066, indicating the average error in predicting house prices.

6. Visualizations:The project provides visual analysis to better understand the model’s predictions:
- A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted house prices helps visualize how closely the model’s predictions align with real prices. A diagonal pattern suggests good predictive performance.

7. Model Prediction: After training, the model is used to predict house prices on the test set. These predictions are compared to the actual values to assess model accuracy.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the XGBoost algorithm for house price prediction, providing high accuracy in a real-world regression task. It highlights the power of boosting algorithms and how they can outperform traditional methods by combining the predictions of multiple models to improve performance.
